"""DTOs for the live now-playing presence feed.

A `NowPlayingReport` is what the native web player POSTs as a heartbeat; the
`NowPlayingSnapshot` (list of `NowPlayingSnapshotEntry`) is what the read endpoint
and the SSE channel emit, already privacy-projected per the owner's visibility
setting. Redacted entries keep identity + progress but carry empty track fields.
